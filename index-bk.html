                One interesting thing emerged from search data is that across years, there seem to always have slightly more searches for birthday during the month of July, August and September. And a huge drop during the month of November and December.

                <div class="title">Gifts search for mom</div>
                Mom as a popular subject for gifts search holds an interetsing pattern. The slight peak in May is probably the result of Mother's day but the huge peak in December seems to indicate mom is also a popular gift receiver during the time of Christmas.

                <div class="title">Gifts search for dad</div>
                Interestingly enough, gifts search for dad follows a similar pattern as the search for mom did. Despite the slight peak in June, which possible caused by Father's day, the huge peak came in December. Both side of the parents seems to receive gifts a lot during the month of Decemeber.

                <div class="title">Gifts search for boyfriend</div>
                The gifts search pattern for boyfriend is also very similar to the search pattern for mom and dad did. With a smaller peak in the month of Feburary probably due to Valentine's Day, the search term reaches its max on December as well.

                <!-- case 4 -->
                <div class="title">Gift search for girlfriend</div>
                Same pattern shows up for the gifts search for girlfriend as the search pattern for boyfriend did—a small peak in Feburary with a huge peak in December. December seem to be a huge month for gifts maybe due to Christmas and New Year.
